    <!-- Description Food -->
    <string name="patate_cozze_description">A dish of both land and sea, the "tiella" barese inebriates the streets around the Basilica of San Nicola for over four centuries. every Bari family prepares it differently: who puts more potatoes, more rice, sometimes whole tomatoes, some add salsa and who, again, neither of the above and who, on the other hand, also add courgette.</string>
    <string name="fave_cicoria_description">Fave e cicoria (fava beans and chicory) is a popular dish in Puglia, the heel of Italy’s boot. It takes inspiration from Egyptian bean purées across the Mediterranean, and uses a few quality ingredients in similar ways. Bitter greens balance the warm, hearty ﬂavor of the bean puree perfectly in this simple 4-ingredient dish.</string>
    <string name="orecchiette_cime_rapa_description">Puglia’s sun-soaked landscape in southern Italy is celebrated for its signature dish, orecchiette with broccoli rabe. The pasta’s “little ears,” as “orecchiette” translates, are a homemade pasta made exclusively in southern italy.</string>
    <string name="focaccia_description">Focaccia Barese is a street food with very light dough, different than pizza. It’s topped with Olio Terra di Bari, oven baked black olives and tomatoes. A speciality you must try without  . </string>
    <string name="panzerotti_description">Strictly fried and strictly accompanied by a cold beer: praise to the panzerotto. A must, a symbol, a tradition. Bari without him would not be the same and the people without the long-awaited "panzerottata" would have one less reason to look forward to Christmas Eve.</string>
